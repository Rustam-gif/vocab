## 🔧 RECOMMENDED FIXES

### Priority 1: Expand Short Definitions (Sets 7-20)
All 70 words in Sets 7-20 need their definitions expanded from 5 words to 7-8 words to match distractor lengths.

**Examples of needed fixes:**
- ❌ "Arrange tasks by importance level" (5 words)
- ✅ "Arrange tasks in order of their importance level" (8 words)

- ❌ "Plan showing when events happen" (5 words)
- ✅ "A plan showing when events will happen" (7 words)

- ❌ "Delay event to later time" (5 words)
- ✅ "To delay an event to a later time" (8 words)

### Priority 2: Review Distractor Quality
Some distractors may be too similar to correct answers (e.g., "A plan showing when things will happen or occur" vs "Plan showing when events happen").

### Priority 3: Ensure Uniqueness
Verify no duplicate options can appear in the same MCQ question.

## 📈 PROGRESS SUMMARY

- **Total words:** 100
- **Definitions fixed:** 30 (30%)
- **Definitions remaining:** 70 (70%)
- **Distractor quality:** Good (all 100 topics covered)
- **Uniqueness bug:** Fixed ✅

**Estimated work remaining:** Need to expand 70 definitions in `levels.ts` (Sets 7-20) from 5 words to 7-8 words.
